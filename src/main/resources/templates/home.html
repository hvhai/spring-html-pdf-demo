                mobile-first should also be great, too…right?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, not necessarily. Classic mobile-first CSS development is based on the principle of overwriting
                style declarations: you begin your CSS with default style declarations, and overwrite and/or add new
                styles as you add breakpoints with <code>min-width</code> media queries for larger viewports (for a good
                overview see “<a
                        href="https://www.mightyminnow.com/2013/11/what-is-mobile-first-css-and-why-does-it-rock/">What
                    is Mobile First CSS and Why Does It Rock?</a>”). But all those exceptions create complexity and
                inefficiency, which in turn can lead to an increased testing effort and a code base that’s harder to
                maintain. Admit it—how many of us willingly want that?</p>


            <p>On your own projects, mobile-first CSS may yet be the best tool for the job, but first you need to
                evaluate just how appropriate it is in light of the visual design and user interactions you’re working
                on. To help you get started, here’s how I go about tackling the factors you need to watch for, and I’ll
                discuss some alternate solutions if mobile-first doesn’t seem to suit your project.</p>


            <h2 id="section2" class="wp-block-heading">Advantages of mobile-first<a class="subhead-anchor"
                                                                                    href="#section2">#section2</a></h2>


            <p>Some of the things to like with mobile-first CSS development—and why it’s been the de facto development
                methodology for so long—make a lot of sense:</p>


            <p><strong>Development hierarchy. </strong>One thing you undoubtedly get from mobile-first is a nice
                development hierarchy—you just focus on the mobile view and get developing.&nbsp;</p>


            <p><strong>Tried and tested. </strong>It’s a tried and tested methodology that’s worked for years for a
                reason: it solves a problem really well.</p>


            <p><strong>Prioritizes the mobile view</strong>. The mobile view is
                the<strong> </strong>simplest<strong> </strong>and arguably the most important, as it <strong>encompasses
                    all the key user journeys</strong>, and often accounts for a <strong>higher proportion of user
                    visits</strong> (depending on the project).&nbsp;</p>


            <p><strong>Prevents desktop-centric development. </strong>As development is done using desktop computers, it
                can be tempting to initially focus on the desktop view. But thinking about mobile from the start
                prevents us from getting stuck later on; no one wants to spend their time retrofitting a desktop-centric
                site to work on mobile devices!</p>


            <h2 id="section3" class="wp-block-heading">Disadvantages of mobile-first<a class="subhead-anchor"
                                                                                       href="#section3">#section3</a>
            </h2>


            <p>Setting style declarations and then overwriting them at higher breakpoints can lead to undesirable
                ramifications:</p>


            <p><strong>More complexity. </strong>The farther up the breakpoint hierarchy you go, the more unnecessary
                code you inherit from lower breakpoints.&nbsp;</p>


            <p><strong>Higher CSS specificity. </strong>Styles that have been reverted to their browser default value in
                a class name declaration now have a higher specificity. This can be a headache on large projects when
                you want to keep the CSS selectors as simple as possible.</p>


            <p><strong>Requires more regression testing. </strong>Changes to the CSS at a lower view (like adding a new
                style) requires all higher breakpoints to be regression tested.</p>


            <p><strong>The browser can’t prioritize CSS downloads. </strong>At wider breakpoints, classic mobile-first
                <code>min-width</code> media queries don’t leverage the browser’s capability to download CSS files in
                priority order.</p>


            <h2 id="section4" class="wp-block-heading">The problem of property value overrides<a class="subhead-anchor"
                                                                                                 href="#section4">#section4</a>
            </h2>


            <p>There is nothing inherently wrong with overwriting values; CSS was designed to do just that. Still,
                inheriting incorrect values is unhelpful and can be burdensome and inefficient. It can also lead to
                increased style specificity when you have to overwrite styles to reset them back to their defaults,
                something that may cause issues later on, especially if you are using a combination of bespoke CSS and
                utility classes. We won’t be able to use a utility class for a style that has been reset with a higher
                specificity.</p>


            <p>With this in mind, I’m developing CSS with a focus on the default values much more these days. Since
                there’s no specific order, and no chains of specific values to keep track of, this frees me to develop
                breakpoints <em>simultaneously</em>. I concentrate on finding common styles and isolating the specific
                exceptions in closed media query ranges (that is, any range with a <code>max-width</code> set).&nbsp;
            </p>


            <p>This approach opens up some opportunities, as you can look at each breakpoint as a clean slate. If a
                component’s layout looks like it should be based on Flexbox at all breakpoints, it’s fine and can be
                coded in the default style sheet. But if it looks like Grid would be much better for large screens and
                Flexbox for mobile, these can both be done entirely independently when the CSS is put into closed media
                query ranges. Also, developing simultaneously requires you to have a good understanding of any given
                component in all breakpoints up front. This can help surface issues in the design earlier in the
                development process. We don’t want to get stuck down a rabbit hole building a complex component for
                mobile, and then get the designs for desktop and find they are equally complex and incompatible with the
                HTML we created for the mobile view!&nbsp;</p>


            <p>Though this approach isn’t going to suit everyone, I encourage you to give it a try. There are plenty of
                tools out there to help with concurrent development, such as <a href="https://responsively.app/">Responsively

            <p>Having said that, I don’t feel the order itself is particularly relevant. If you are comfortable with
                focusing on the mobile view, have a good understanding of the requirements for other breakpoints, and
                prefer to work on one device at a time, then by all means stick with the classic development order. The
                important thing is to identify common styles and exceptions so you can put them in the relevant
                stylesheet—a sort of manual tree-shaking process! Personally, I find this a little easier when working
                on a component across breakpoints, but that’s by no means a requirement.</p>


            <h2 id="section5" class="wp-block-heading">Closed media query ranges in practice&nbsp;<a
                    class="subhead-anchor" href="#section5">#section5</a></h2>


            <p>In classic mobile-first CSS we overwrite the styles, but we can avoid this by using media query ranges.
                To illustrate the difference (I’m using SCSS for brevity), let’s assume there are three visual designs:&nbsp;</p>


            <ul>
                <li>smaller than 768</li>
                <li>from 768 to below 1024</li>
                <li>1024 and anything larger&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Take a simple example where a block-level element has a default <code>padding</code> of “20px,” which is
                overwritten at tablet to be “40px” and set back to “20px” on desktop.</p>


            <figure id="figure1" class="wp-block-table">
                <table>
                    <tbody>

                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </figure>


            <p>The subtle difference is that the mobile-first example sets the default <code>padding</code> to “20px”
                and then overwrites it at each breakpoint, setting it three times in total. In contrast, the second
                example sets the default <code>padding</code> to “20px” and only overrides it at the relevant breakpoint
                where it isn’t the default value (in this instance, tablet is the exception).</p>


            <p>The goal is to:&nbsp;</p>


            <ul>
                <li>Only set styles when needed.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Not set them with the <em>expectation</em> of overwriting them later on, again and again.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>


            <p>To this end, closed media query ranges are our best friend. If we need to make a change to any given
                view, we make it in the CSS media query range that applies to the specific breakpoint. We’ll be much
                less likely to introduce unwanted alterations, and our regression testing only needs to focus on the
                breakpoint we have actually edited.&nbsp;</p>


            <p>Taking the above example, if we find that <code>.my-block</code> spacing on desktop is already accounted
                for by the margin at that breakpoint, and since we want to remove the padding altogether, we could do
                this by setting the mobile <code>padding</code> in a closed media query range.<br></br></p>


            <figure id="figure2" class="wp-block-table">
<pre id="snippet3" class=" language-css"><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">.my-block </span><span
        class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token atrule">@media (max-width: 767.98px) </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">padding</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 20px<span
            class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
  <span class="token atrule">@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023.98px) </span><span
            class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">padding</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 40px<span

  <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
            </figure>


            <p>The browser default <code>padding</code> for our block is “0,” so instead of adding a desktop media query
                and using <code>unset</code> or “0” for the <code>padding</code> value (which we would need with
                mobile-first), we can wrap the mobile <code>padding</code> in a closed media query (since it is now also
                an exception) so it won’t get picked up at wider breakpoints. At the desktop breakpoint, we won’t need
                to set any <code>padding</code> style, as we want the browser default value.</p>

            </h2>


            <p>Back in the day, keeping the number of requests to a minimum was very important due to the browser’s
                limit of concurrent requests (typically around six). As a consequence, the use of image sprites and CSS
                bundling was the norm, with all the CSS being downloaded in one go, as one stylesheet with highest
                priority.&nbsp;</p>


            <p>With HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 now on the scene, the number of requests is no longer the big deal it used to be.
                This allows us to separate the CSS into multiple files by media query. The clear benefit of this is the
                browser can now request the CSS it currently needs with a higher priority than the CSS it doesn’t. This
                is more performant and can reduce the overall time <a
                        href="https://web.dev/critical-rendering-path-render-blocking-css/">page rendering is
                    blocked</a>.</p>

            </h3>


            <p>To determine which version of HTTP you’re using, go to your website and open your browser’s dev tools.
                Next, select the <strong>Network</strong> tab and make sure the <strong>Protocol</strong> column is
                visible. If “h2” is listed under <strong>Protocol</strong>, it means HTTP/2 is being used.&nbsp;</p>


            <p><em>Note: to view the Protocol in your browser’s dev tools, go to
                the </em><strong><em>Network</em></strong><em> tab, reload your page, right-click any column header
                (e.g., </em><strong><em>Name</em></strong><em>), and check
                the </em><strong><em>Protocol</em></strong><em> column.</em></p>

            <p>Separating the CSS into inidual files is a worthwhile task. Linking the separate CSS files using the
                relevant <code>media</code> attribute allows the browser to identify which files are needed immediately
                (because they’re render-blocking) and which can be deferred. Based on this, it allocates each file an
                appropriate priority.</p>


            <p>In the following example of a website visited on a mobile breakpoint, we can see the mobile and default
                CSS are loaded with “Highest” priority, as they are currently needed to render the page. The remaining
                CSS files (print, tablet, and desktop) are still downloaded in case they’ll be needed later, but with
                “Lowest” priority.&nbsp;</p>

            <figure id="figure4" class="wp-block-image"><img
                    src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RZOq-S7kbVsavDiFctQl6STFgGm6puwG8L22V6j6U1vUfo73Opq3Cspj2N94T2BU5lpYUD7Bb_4krFCXlePvBE8xXJVMFwbc_At8pzc-C5ug-6lrPViwMIIXgbKiJA-2fQ3beDoYfkCflCVgwg"
                    alt="Chrome dev tools, Network tab filtered by css, Priority column"></img></figure>


            <p><br></br>With<strong> bundled CSS</strong>, the browser will have to download the CSS file and parse it
            before
            rendering can start.<br></br><br></br>While, as noted, with the <strong>CSS separated into different
            files</strong> linked and marked up with the relevant <code>media</code> attribute, the browser can
            prioritize the files it currently needs. Using closed media query ranges allows the browser to do this
            at all widths, as opposed to classic mobile-first <code>min-width</code> queries, where the desktop
            browser would have to download all the CSS with Highest priority. We can’t assume that desktop users
            </p>


            <p>The media queries and number of separate CSS files will vary from project to project based on project
                requirements, but might look similar to the example below.</p>

            <figure id="figure5" class="wp-block-table">

                                the five files listed above, two will be downloaded with Highest priority: the default
                                file, and the file that matches the current media query. The others will be downloaded
                                with Lowest priority.</p>

            <p>Depending on the project’s deployment strategy, a change to one file (<code>mobile.css</code>, for
                example) would only require the QA team to regression test on devices in that specific media query
                range. Compare that to the prospect of deploying the single bundled <code>site.css</code> file, an
                approach that would normally trigger a full regression test.</p>

            <p>The uptake of mobile-first CSS was a really important milestone in web development; it has helped
                front-end developers focus on mobile web applications, rather than developing sites on desktop and then
                attempting to retrofit them to work on other devices.</p>


            <p>I don’t think anyone wants to return to that development model again, but it’s important we don’t lose
                sight of the issue it highlighted: that things can easily get convoluted and less efficient if we
                prioritize one particular device—any device—over others. For this reason, focusing on the CSS in its own
                right, always mindful of what is the default setting and what’s an exception, seems like the natural
                next step. I’ve started noticing small simplifications in my own CSS, as well as other developers’, and
                that testing and maintenance work is also a bit more simplified and productive.&nbsp;</p>


            <p>In general, simplifying CSS rule creation whenever we can is ultimately a cleaner approach than going
                around in circles of overrides. But whichever methodology you choose, it needs to suit the project.
                Mobile-first may—or may not—turn out to be the best choice for what’s involved, but first you need to
                solidly understand the trade-offs you’re stepping into.</p>

                                    can free us from forty years of design constraints telling us how applications
                                    should look. Thirty pixels, it turns out, are full of exciting design opportunities.
